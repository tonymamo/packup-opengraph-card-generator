# Packup Open Graph Image Generator Kit

An image generation API template.

It generates an image with a short message and a contour background. Each contour is unique and derived from the username. The user's avatar is pulled from the firestore data via a fetch call using the query string parameters.

Once deployed, try navigating to `https://packup-opengraph-card-generator.netlify.app/image?username=PACKUP_USERNAME`.

## Architecture

The whole thing is powered by an image generation API. The image is implemented as a React component. A Netlify Functions handles the requests, spins-up a headless browser with Playwright to screenshot the DOM ðŸ“¸ And returns an image.

## Cloudinary Write-Through Cache

Using the `process-url` function, we check in Cloudinary to see if the image already exists, and if it doesn't, then using the Cloudinary Fetch API to ping back to the `shout-out-image` function here to generate the image and then save it in Cloudinary.

It's a pared back version of Christopher Biscardi's wonderful [Building an OpenGraph image generation API](https://egghead.io/playlists/building-an-opengraph-image-generation-api-with-cloudinary-netlify-functions-and-react-914e) course.

The build setup is configured via the `Makefile`.

### Run it locally
